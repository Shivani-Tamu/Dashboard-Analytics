# Dashboard-Analytics
High level plan - A dashboard to understand the user behavior and activity.
The 'Dashboard Analytics' project is being designed for an AI video-based product which enables people to connect by sharing videos. This product is being widely used amongst the sales, HR and marketing teams in the enterprises.

The sales/HR team of these enterprises want to understand the user behavior over their videos shared/published etc. and draw inferences.
The Dashboard will be created using data from these users.
There are several steps to this process:

1) The first step is to convert the JSON file to CSV to create an aggregated table.
2) Establish connection with MongoDB on MS Azure and retrieve data (alongwith number of documents in the database)
